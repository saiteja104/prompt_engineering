The objective function to maximize is the profit: P = 12w + 15g. We also have non-negativity constraints: w >= 0, g >= 0. We solve the system of inequalities to find feasible solutions. Using substitution or graphical methods, we find: At w = 40, g = 0, material A uses 120 units and material B uses 80 units, which satisfies both constraints. At w = 0, g = 40, material A uses 80 units and material B uses 160 units, which also satisfies both constraints. At w = 20, g = 30, material A uses 180 units and material B uses 140 units, which satisfies both constraints. Now, calculate the profit for these points: (w = 40, g = 0) gives P = 12(40) + 15(0) = $480. (w = 0, g = 40) gives P = 12(0) + 15(40) = $600. (w = 20, g = 30) gives P = 12(20) + 15(30) = $660.

The feasible region is bounded by these lines. The vertices of this region will give potential maximum profit points. Solving these intersections, we find: 1) W = 0, G = 40; 2) G = 0, W = 60; 3) W = 20, G = 30. Calculating profit at these points: For (W, G) = (0, 40), P = 12*0 + 15*40 = 600.

Let's denote the number of widgets produced as 'w' and the number of gadgets produced as 'g'. Each widget uses 3 units of material A and 2 units of material B. Each gadget uses 2 units of material A and 4 units of material B. The constraints are: 3w + 2g <= 180 (for material A) and 2w + 4g <= 160 (for material B). The profit function to maximize is 12w + 15g. We solve the inequalities: 1) 3w + 2g <= 180, 2) 2w + 4g <= 160. Simplifying 2), we get w + 2g <= 80. To find the maximum profit, we check the vertices of the feasible region defined by these inequalities. Solving for g in terms of w for each inequality: From 1), g = (180 - 3w)/2. From 2), g = (80 - w)/2. Setting them equal: (180 - 3w)/2 = (80 - w)/2, which simplifies to 180 - 3w = 80 - w, giving 2w = 100, so w = 50. Substituting w = 50 into g = (80 - w)/2 gives g = 15. Substituting back to check: 3(50) + 2(15) = 150 + 30 = 180 <= 180 and 2(50) + 4(15) = 100 + 60 = 160 <= 160. The vertex (w, g) = (50, 15) is valid. At this point, profit is 12(50) + 15(15) = 600 + 225 = 825. Checking other vertices, such as (60, 0) or (0, 40), gives profits of 720 and 600 respectively, which are lower than 825. Thus, maximum profit is at w = 50 and g = 15, giving a maximum profit of $825.\",\n",

Each widget requires 3 units of material A and 2 units of material B, and each gadget requires 2 units of material A and 4 units of material B. The factory has 180 units of material A and 160 units of material B available. The profit for each widget is $12, and for each gadget, it is $15. Let's set up the constraints: 1. 3W + 2G ≤ 180 (material A constraint) 2. 2W + 4G ≤ 160 (material B constraint) We also have the non-negativity constraints: W ≥ 0, G ≥ 0. The objective is to maximize the profit function: P = 12W + 15G. We will use the method of linear programming to find the optimal solution. First, let's consider the constraint equations: 1. Divide the first constraint by 3: W + (2/3)G ≤ 60. 2. Divide the second constraint by 2: W + 2G ≤ 80. Now let's find the intersection points which are potential solutions: Check intersections of lines W + (2/3)G = 60 and W + 2G = 80: Multiply W + (2/3)G = 60 by 3 to eliminate fractions: 3W + 2G = 180 (same as the original constraint). Now solve: 3W + 2G = 180 and W + 2G = 80. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives: 2W = 100, so W = 50. Substituting W = 50 into W + 2G = 80 gives: 50 + 2G = 80, so 2G = 30, thus G = 15. The intersection point is (W, G) = (50, 15). Check whether this point satisfies both constraints: 3W + 2G = 3(50) + 2(15) = 150 + 30 = 180 (satisfied), 2W + 4G = 2(50) + 4(15) = 100 + 60 = 160 (satisfied). Thus, the solution (W, G) = (50, 15) is feasible. Calculate the profit: P = 12(50) + 15(15) = 600 + 225 = 825.
