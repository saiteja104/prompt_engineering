      " Duck typing is a concept in programming, particularly in dynamically typed languages, where an object's suitability for use in a particular context is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the actual type of the object. The term comes from the saying, \"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\" In other words, the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines and the way it behaves.\n",
      "\n",

The profit function to maximize is P = 12x + 15y. First, solve the system of inequalities: 1) 3x + 2y <= 180 2) 2x + 4y <= 160. Simplifying 2), we get x + 2y <= 80. Graph these inequalities to find the feasible region. The vertices of the feasible region are potential candidates for maximizing profit. Calculate P at each vertex: 1) (0, 0): P = 12(0) + 15(0) = 0. 2) (60, 0): P = 12(60) + 15(0) = 720. 3) (40, 20): P = 12(40) + 15(20) = 780. 4) (0, 40): P = 12(0) + 15(40) = 600.

The constraints based on material availability are: 3x + 2y ≤ 180 (for material A) and 2x + 4y ≤ 160 (for material B). The objective function to maximize is the profit: P = 12x + 15y. First, solve the constraints for y: From 3x + 2y ≤ 180, we get y ≤ (180 - 3x)/2. From 2x + 4y ≤ 160, we get y ≤ (160 - 2x)/4 or y ≤ 40 - 0.5x. These inequalities form a feasible region on the coordinate plane. The vertices of this region, where the maximum can occur, are found by solving the system of equations given by the boundaries: 1) Setting y = (180 - 3x)/2 and y = (160 - 2x)/4 equal, solve for x: (180 - 3x)/2 = (160 - 2x)/4. This simplifies to 360 - 6x = 160 - 2x, leading to 4x = 200, so x = 50. Substitute x = 50 into y = (180 - 3x)/2 to find y = (180 - 150)/2 = 15. Thus, one vertex is (50, 15). 2) Other vertices are obtained by checking intersections with axes: if x = 0, y = 40 from the second constraint, and if y = 0, from the first constraint, x = 60. The possible points are (0, 0), (60, 0), (0, 40), and (50, 15). Calculate the profit at these points: P(0, 0) = 0, P(60, 0) = 720, P(0, 40) = 600, P(50, 15) = 885.

Now, let's solve the inequalities. 1) For 3x + 2y ≤ 180, if x = 0, then y ≤ 90. If y = 0, then x ≤ 60. 2) For 2x + 4y ≤ 160, if x = 0, then y ≤ 40. If y = 0, then x ≤ 80. Let's find the intersection points of these inequalities by solving the equations 3x + 2y = 180 and 2x + 4y = 160 simultaneously. Solving these gives us the point (40, 30). Now we evaluate the profit function P at the vertices of the feasible region determined by these constraints: (0,0), (60,0), (0,40), and (40,30).

Let x be the number of widgets produced and y be the number of gadgets produced. The objective function to maximize is the profit: P = 12x + 15y. The constraints based on material availability are: 1) For material A: 3x + 2y <= 180. 2) For material B: 2x + 4y <= 160. 3) Non-negativity constraints: x >= 0, y >= 0. First, we solve the system of equations formed by the constraints: 1) 3x + 2y = 180, 2) 2x + 4y = 160. Solving these, we find x = 40, y = 20. Check these values against the constraints: For material A: 3(40) + 2(20) = 120 + 40 = 160 <= 180. For material B: 2(40) + 4(20) = 80 + 80 = 160 <= 160. Both constraints are satisfied. Now calculate the profit: P = 12(40) + 15(20) = 480 + 300 = 780. Therefore, the maximum profit is $780.\",\n",
